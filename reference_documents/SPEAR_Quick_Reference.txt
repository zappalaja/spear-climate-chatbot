SPEAR Climate Model Quick Reference
====================================

SPEAR (Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research)
Developed by NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)

Model Configurations
--------------------

SPEAR_MED (Medium Resolution):
- Atmospheric resolution: ~100 km (C96 cubed-sphere grid)
- Ocean resolution: ~1° (0.25° in tropics)
- Vertical levels: 33 atmosphere, 75 ocean
- Primary use: Climate projections and seasonal-to-decadal prediction
- Maximum ensemble size: 30 members

SPEAR_LO (Low Resolution):
- Atmospheric resolution: ~200 km (C48)
- Optimized for large ensembles (100+ members)
- Faster computation for uncertainty quantification

SPEAR_HI (High Resolution):
- Atmospheric resolution: ~50 km (C192)
- Better for tropical cyclones and regional features
- More computationally expensive

Key Variables
-------------

Temperature Variables:
- tas: Near-surface (2m) air temperature in Kelvin
- tasmax: Daily maximum temperature
- tasmin: Daily minimum temperature
- tos: Sea surface temperature

Precipitation:
- pr: Total precipitation rate (kg m-2 s-1)
- prsn: Snowfall rate
- Convert pr to mm/day: multiply by 86400

Wind:
- uas: Eastward wind component at 10m
- vas: Northward wind component at 10m
- sfcWind: Wind speed magnitude

Available Scenarios
-------------------

historical (1850-2014):
- Observed forcings: GHGs, aerosols, solar, volcanoes
- Use for model validation and baseline

scenarioSSP5-8.5 (2015-2100):
- High emissions pathway
- ~8.5 W/m² radiative forcing by 2100
- ~4-5°C global warming by 2100
- Represents continued fossil fuel reliance

Ensemble Member Naming
----------------------

Format: rXiYpZfW
- r = realization (different initial conditions)
- i = initialization method
- p = physics parameterization
- f = forcing dataset

Example: r15i1p1f1
- 15th ensemble member
- Standard initialization, physics, and forcing

Data Access
-----------

Storage: AWS S3 (NOAA Open Data Program)
Format: NetCDF4 with CF conventions
Grids: gr3 (regridded), gn (native)

Frequencies:
- Amon: Monthly atmospheric
- day: Daily means
- Omon: Monthly ocean
- 6hrLev: 6-hourly pressure levels

Best Practices
--------------

1. Use ensemble means to reduce natural variability noise
2. Temperature projections more certain than precipitation
3. Global/hemispheric patterns more certain than regional
4. Always check metadata (coordinates, time, scenario, ensemble)
5. SPEAR is one model - compare with CMIP6 multi-model for robustness

Model Limitations
-----------------

- ~100 km resolution limits small-scale features
- Clouds and convection are parameterized
- Regional biases exist (especially precipitation)
- Single model perspective (not multi-model consensus)
- Ocean eddies parameterized (not explicit in SPEAR_MED)

Quality Notes
-------------

Strengths:
- Large ensembles for uncertainty quantification
- Well-validated against observations
- Active development at GFDL
- Seamless prediction across timescales

Use with caution for:
- Local/city-scale projections
- Extreme event frequency (needs large ensemble)
- Precipitation patterns (higher uncertainty)
- Tipping points and abrupt changes
